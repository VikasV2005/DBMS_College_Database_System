# College Management System - DBMS Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a College Management System database using SQL and Python. It manages information related to colleges, departments, professors, and students, supporting key features such as data integrity, triggers, stored procedures, and CRUD operations via a Python GUI.

## Features
- College, Department, Professor, and Student data management
- Data integrity enforced through foreign keys and constraints
- Triggers for automatic data validation and transformation
- Stored procedures and functions for encapsulated operations
- Python Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction with the database
- Sample datasets and test cases included

## Technologies Used
- Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL (SQL scripts provided)
- Programming Language: Python 3 (Tkinter GUI)
- Tools: SQL scripts, Python scripts

## Project Structure
- `PES2UG23CS694_PES2UG23CS689.sql` — Database schema and data scripts
- `miniproject.py` — Python GUI application for interacting with the database
- `Report` — Project report and related documents

## Setup Instructions
1. Set up a MySQL/PostgreSQL database server.
2. Execute the SQL script `PES2UG23CS694_PES2UG23CS689.sql` to create tables, triggers, and procedures.
3. Populate the tables with the sample data provided in the script.
4. Install Python 3 and Tkinter.
5. Run `miniproject.py` to launch the GUI application.
6. Use the GUI to perform CRUD operations and test other database functionalities.
